# Performance_of_NOMA_Based_CRS
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technique for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications. As users with good channel conditions can serve as relays to enhance the system performance by using successive interference cancellation (SIC), the integration of NOMA and cooperative relaying system.
